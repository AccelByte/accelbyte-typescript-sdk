### Patch Changes

- cfb0dba: AGS TypeScript SDK

  - SDK Initialization: The SDK now requires two separate fields: `coreConfig` and `axiosConfig` for initialization, instead of a single options object. This change was made to clearly separate concerns between core SDK configurations and Axios-specific configurations, improving clarity and flexibility.
  - Return Response: API function calls now return `{ data, headers, status }` instead of just `data`.
  - Event Listeners: Event listeners (e.g., `onSessionExpired`) have been replaced by Axios interceptors.
  - Interceptors: Moving event listeners to interceptors improves customization, allowing consumers to handle events and errors through the Axios interceptor rather than relying on SDK-specific events.
  - Token Repository: Allow tokens to be attached in SDK and rename `refreshTokens` method to `setToken` for Extend compatibilty.
  - API Classes and Methods: Fix redundant API Classes name and inaccurate methods name.
  - Generated React Query: Optionally access AGS using react-query for better server-state management.
